### PHP i Patterns

In this section, we work with the SOLID principles, which are a fundamental set of guidelines for building software that is easier to understand, maintain, and extend over time. Each exercise focuses on a specific principle and demonstrates how applying good object oriented design leads to cleaner and more robust code.

**- Level 1 -**

- Exercise 1 – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
  The first exercise is based on the Single Responsibility Principle, which states:
  “A class should have only one reason to change.”

- Exercise 2 – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
  The second exercise works with the Dependency Inversion Principle, which states:
  High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

**- Level 2 -**

- Exercise 3 – Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
  The third exercise is based on the Open/Closed Principle, which states:
  A class should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

- Exercise 4 – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
  In the fourth exercise, we apply the Interface Segregation Principle, which states:
  A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.

**- Level 3 -**

- Exercise 5 – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
  Finally, we work with the Liskov Substitution Principle, which states:
  Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.
